### Overview

Welcome traveler to the kingdom of **Greater Arthia**. 

For those of you who are new here, we have both a history and geography lesson to get you up to speed.

#### Geography

**Greater Arthia** is a large empire covering most of the Eastern and Western continents of **Easorhn**.

**Arthia** is the capitol city of **Greater Arthia** and the seat of power for the government. It is centrally located on the western continent to ensure that edicts from the crown reach every corner of **Greater Arthia** at around the same time. The original kingdom of **Arthia** was the area around the city but has fallen into disuse over the centuries.

The central channel bisecting the empire is known simply as **the Bore**. Due to this geopgraphy, **Greater Arthia** has a thriving marine economy.
A large frontier extends to the East from the settled realms of **Greater Arthia**; **Kargonia** is located centrally in this frontier zone.

There are two other metropli in the empire, **Kargonia** in the northeast frontier and the **Nyissan** port of **Ischia** to the west across **the Bore**. There is a large ciy, though not a metropolis, named **Manteflaro** *(this will change)* located on the southeastern shore at the mouth of the river **Nespo**.

#### History

***Elroode I*** came to power in the year 640 in the petty kingdom of **Arthia**, a small, centrally located province on the northern continent of **Easorhn**. He immediately went on a campaign of conquest, eventually controlling most of modern day **Greater Arthia**. Sometime in 644 he took the title High King to denote his expanding conquest and added the prefix '***Greater***' to his much-expanded realm of **Arthia**. Upon his death without an heir, his crown was taken by his seneschal, ***Kargon***. It's borders have since stayed more or less the same and the people have drifted ever more towards lawful evil over the centuries.

#### High Kings of Greater Arthia

- ***Elroode I***    -  640 to 646
- ***Kargon I***     -  646 to 693
- ***Kargon II***    -  693 to 741
- ***Kargon III***   -  741 to 801
- ***Kargon IV***   -  801 to 865
- ***Kargon V***    -  865 to 928
- ***Kargon VI***   -  928 to 979
- ***Kargon VII***  -  979 to 1004
- ***Kargon VIII*** -  1004 to 1021

The populace assume that the last 8 kings of this empire are showing respect for their ancestors by taking the name of his predecessors; this couldn't be farther from the truth. All eight kings named ***Kargon*** were, in fact, the same being. ***Kargon*** was, in fact, a cambion and used this ruse to keep the population from rising up against his tyranny with the full knowledge of the ***Arthian Council of Ministers***. 

#### Current Affairs

###### *Day 137 of the year 1021*

The charismatic, *not to mention eminently bedable*, ***Kargon VIII***, High King of all of **Greater Arthia**, like all his predecessors whose name he shared was known for two things; his over the top debauchery and his exceedingly great charm. As a direct result of this hedonistic nature he has recently died in a most spectacular fashion. 

The knave had the temerity to leave behind no 'direct' heirs and the lines of succession contain no less than 100 bastards of every imaginable race; most of which are 'officially' heirs of 'one' of the prior kings sharing his name. What's a profitable evil kingdom to do?  

The ***Arthian Council of Ministers***, in it's infinite wisdom (*not to mention its craven nature of self-preservation against powerful heirs*), has divided the kingdom into one hundred counties of varying sizes and distributed them among those with claim to the throne hoping that most will die in the ensuing power struggle. Let the High King's true heir rise to the top of the heap!
